Quantitative Hydrologic Storylines
==================================

**storylines** is a framework for characterizing uncertainty in traditional
hydroloic climate impacts modeling chains (climate models, downscaling methods,
hydrologic models). It includes tools for evaluating model fidelity and culling
models accordingly to reduce these uncertainties, and finally distilling
projections into a discrete set of quantitative hydrologic storylines that
represent key, impact-focused, features from the full range of future
scenarios.

**storylines** is being developed at the National Center for Atmospheric
Research (NCAR_), Research Applications Laboratory (RAL_) - Hydrometeorological
Applications Program (HAP_) under the support of USACE.
