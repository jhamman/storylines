# Quantitative Hydrologic Storylines
Using quantitative hydrologic storylines to assess climate impacts

*Fig. 1 Clark et al. (2016): Schematic on approaches to explicitly characterize and reduce the myriad uncertainties in assessments of the hydrologic impacts of climate change and the development of representative quantitative hydrologic storylines for specific applications.*

## Overview

**storylines** is a framework for characterizing uncertainty in traditional
hydroloic climate impacts modeling chains (climate models, downscaling methods,
hydrologic models).
It includes tools for evaluating model fidelity and culling models accordingly to reduce these uncertainties, and finally distilling projections into a discrete set of quantitative hydrologic storylines that represent key, impact-focused, features from the full range of future scenarios.

**storylines** is being developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research ([NCAR](http://ncar.ucar.edu/)), Research Applications Laboratory ([RAL](https://www.ral.ucar.edu)) - Hydrometeorological Applications Program ([HAP](https://www.ral.ucar.edu/hap)) under the support of USACE.

## Tools

- Characterization of modeling chain uncertainties
    - Earth System Model (ESM) selection
    - Internal/natural/stochastic variability in ESMs
    - Downscaling methods (e.g. statistical, dynamic)
    - Hydrologic models
    - Hydrologic parameters
- Reducing modeling chain uncertainties
    - Selection of likely scenarios
    - Informed sampling of ESMs
    - Informed sampling of ESM ensemble members
    - Use of more reliable downscaling methods
    - Improved hydrologic model structure
    - Improved parameter estimation

## History

**storylines** is a toolkit developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.
Development began in the fall of 2016.
A review of the critical issues this project aims to tackle is presented in Clark et al. (2016).
